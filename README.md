Welcome to the party. 

To run the app, go to Processing > implementation > GA_syde361, click on any of the .pdes there, and run in processing. 

To get the sound to work, you will need to import a library not directly accessible from the Processing UI.
Copy soundcipher from genetic_algorithm_syde361/libraries into your local ~/Processing/libraries folder.

You may also need to install controlp5 and themidibus, which can be found in Processing.
